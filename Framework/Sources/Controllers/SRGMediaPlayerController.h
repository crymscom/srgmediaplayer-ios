/**
 *  The SRG Media Player library is a mid-level playback library based on `AVPlayer`. It is intended to lower the
 *  implementation costs usually associated with `AVPlayer`, while adding advanced capabilities and extensive
 *  support for all kinds of medias.
 *
 *  The library provides the following components:
 *    - A controller, `SRGMediaPlayerController`, to perform playback.
 *    - A view, `SRGMediaPlayerView`, with which content played by a controller can be displayed.
 *    - A set of overlays to create custom player user interfaces.
 *    - `SRGMediaPlayerViewController`, a view controller with a default user interface for simple playback needs.
 *
 *  ## Controller
 *
 *  `SRGMediaPlayerController` manages the playback of a media from a network stream or a file. Unlike `AVPlayer`
 *  which can be quite tricky to use, `SRGMediaPlayerController` is intended to provide basic and advanced
 *  playback capabilities with low implementation cost:
 *    - Audio and video playback for all kinds of streams (on-demand, live, DVR).
 *    - Playback status information (mostly through notifications or KVO).
 *    - Media information extraction.
 *    - Background playback.
 *    - Simultaneous playback.
 *
 *  In addition, `SRGMediaPlayerController` optionally supports segments. A segment defined as part of a media, specified
 *  by a start time and a duration. Segments make it possible to add a logical structure on top of a media, e.g. topics
 *  in a news show, chapters in a movie, and so on. If segments are associated with the media being played, 
 *  `SRGMediaPlayerController` will:
 *    - Report transitions between segments when they occur (through notifications).
 *    - Skip segments which must must not be played (blocked segments).
 *
 *  ## View
 *
 *  `SRGMediaPlayerController` is a raw media player and is usually not used as is (though it could, for example
 *  when you only need to play audio files). Most of the time, though, you need to display the content being played.
 *  This is the role of `SRGMediaPlayerView`.
 *
 *  By default, a controller provides a lazily instantiated view which can be installed in a view hierarchy. You
 *  can also instantiate an `SRGMediaPlayerView` in a xib or storyboard and bind it to a controller if you prefer.
 *
 *  `SRGMediaPlayerView` supports standard video playback, as well as 360° video playback (with carboard support).
 *  The `viewMode` property can be used to choose how a video should be displayed.
 *
 *  ## Implementing a media player user interface
 *
 *  To implement your own custom media player user interface, you must create your own player class (most probably a view
 *  controller), and delegate playback to an `SRGMediaPlayerController` instance:
 *    - Instantiate `SRGMediaPlayerController` in your player implementation file. If you are using a storyboard or 
 *      a xib to define your player layout, you can also drop a plain object with Interface Builder and assign it the
 *      `SRGMediaPlayerController` class. Be sure to connect an outlet if you need to later refer to it from within
 *      your code.
 *    - When creating a video player, you must add the `view` property somewhere within your view hierarchy so that
 *      the content can be properly displayed:
 *        - If you are instantiating the controller in a storyboard or a nib, this is easily achieved by adding a view 
 *          with the `SRGMediaPlayerView` class to your layout, and binding it to the `view` property right from Interface
 *          Builder.
 *        - If you have instantiated `SRGMediaPlayerController` in code, then you must add the `view` property manually
 *          to your view hierarchy by calling `-[UIView addSubview:]` or one of the similar `UIView` methods. Be sure 
 *          to set constraints or autoresizing masks properly so that the view behaves as expected.
 *      If you only need to implement an audio player, you can skip this step.
 *    - Call one of the play methods to start playing your media.
 *
 *  You should now have a working implementation able to play audios or videos. There is no way for the user to pause
 *  playback or to seek within the media, though. The `SRGMediaPlayer` library provides a few standard controls and
 *   overlays with which you can easily add such functionalities to your custom player.
 *
 *  ## Controls and overlays
 *
 *  The `SRGMediaPlayer` library provides the following set of controls which can be easily connected to a media player
 *  controller instance to report its status or manage playback.
 *
 *  - Buttons:
 *    - `SRGPlaybackButton`: A button to pause or resume playback.
 *    - `SRGPictureInPictureButton`: A button to enter or leave picture in picture playback.
 *  - Sliders:
 *    - `SRGTimeSlider`: A slider to see the current playback progress, seek, and display the elapsed and remaining times.
 *    - `SRGTimelineSlider`: Similar to the time slider, but with the ability to display specific points of interests
 *                           along its track.
 *    - `SRGVolumeView`: A slider to adjust the volume.
 *  - Miscellaneous:
 *    - `SRGPlaybackActivityIndicatorView`: An activity indicator displayed when the player is buffering or seeking.
 *    - `SRGAirPlayButton`: A button which is visible when AirPlay is available.
 *    - `SRGAirPlayView`: An overlay which is visible when external AirPlay playback is active, and which displays the
 *                        current route.
 *    - `SRGTimelineView`: A linear collection to display the segments associated with a media.
 *
 *  Customizing your player layout using the overlays above is straightforward:
 *    - Drop instances of the views you need onto your player layout (or instantiate them in code) and tweak their
 *      appearance.
 *    - Set their `mediaPlayerController` property to point at the underlying controller. If your controller was
 *      instantiated in a storyboard or a xib file, this can be entirely done in Interface Builder via ctrl-dragging.
 *
 *  To switch between available view modes available for a content (e.g. between 360° and cardboard modes), the library
 *  also provides `SRGViewModeButton`, which must be connected to a media player view directly.
 *
 *  Usually, you want to hide overlays after some user inactivity delay. While showing or hiding overlays is something
 *  your implementation is responsible of, the `SRGMediaPlayer` library provides the `SRGActivityGestureRecognizer`
 *  class to easily detect any kind of user activity. Just add this gesture recognizer on the view where you want
 *  to track user activity, and associate a corresponding action to show or hide the interface.
 *
 *  ## Player lifecycle
 *
 *  `SRGMediaPlayerController` is based around `AVPlayer`, which is publicly exposed as a `player` property. You should
 *  avoid controlling playback by acting on this `AVPlayer` instance directly, but you can still use it for any other
 *  purpose:
 *    - Information extraction (e.g. current `AVPlayerItem`, subtitles and audio channels).
 *    - Key-value observation of some other changes you might be interested in (e.g. IceCast / SHOUTcast information).
 *    - AirPlay setup.
 *    - Muting the player.
 *    - etc.
 *
 *  In the course of a controller lifetime, the `player` property might change several times, e.g. when a new media is
 *  played or when playback is stopped. Consequently, `SRGMediaPlayerController` provides lifecycle hooks so that you
 *  can reliably perform additional setup when the internal `AVPlayer` instance is created or destroyed. Those take the
 *  form of optional blocks to which the player is provided as parameter:
 *    - `playerCreationBlock`: This block is called right after player creation.
 *    - `playerDestructionBlock`: This block is called right before player destruction.
 *    - `playerConfigurationBlock`: Specific configuration block called when `-reloadPlayerConfiguration` is called. For
 *                                  consistency, this block is also called right after player creation as well.
 *
 *  ## Player events
 *
 *  The player emits notifications when important changes are detected:
 *    - Playback state changes and errors. Errors are defined in the `SRGMediaPlayerError.h` header file.
 *    - Segment changes and blocked segment skipping.
 *  For more information about the available notifications, have a look at the `SRGMediaPlayerConstants.h` header file.
 *
 *  Some controller properties (e.g. the `playbackState` property) are key-value observable. If not stated explicitly,
 *  KVO might be possible but is not guaranteed. You should in general listen to notifications, though, as they may
 *  convey additional useful information in their associated dictionary.
 *
 *  Note that all notifications and KVO changes are reported on the main thread.
 *
 *  ## Playback management
 *
 *  Several methods have been provided to start playback and pause it, or to seek to a specific time. You can also prepare
 *  the player in a paused state before actually starting playback when you want. As a general rule, play, pause and seek
 *  methods are player instructions to perform those operations: Depending on the state of the player, these operations
 *  are not guaranteed to succeed. In general, you should therefore observe player events, as describe above, for example
 *  when updating your user interface. You cannot namely assume the player will be playing right after `-play` has been
 *  called, for example (but you can still update your interface right after `-play` has been called, by checking the
 *  `playbackState` property). 
 *
 *  In some situations some behaviors can be guaranteed (e.g. when the player has successfully been prepared, calling
 *  `-play` will put it in the playing state immediately) but, in general, you should rely on the playback state property
 *  and respond to its changes.
 *
 *  ## Segments
 *
 *  When playing a media, an optional `segments` parameter can be provided. This parameter must be an array of objects
 *  conforming to the `SRGSegment` protocol. When segments have been supplied to the player, corresponding notifications
 *  will be emitted when segment transitions occur (see above). If you want to display segments, you can use the supplied
 *  `SRGTimelineView` or create your own view, as required by your application.
 *
 *  Overlapping segments are not supported, associated time ranges must be disjoint (the behavior is otherwise undefined).
 *
 *  ## Boundary time and periodic time observers
 *
 *  Three kinds of observers can be set on a player to observe its playback:
 *    - Usual boundary time and periodic time observers, which you define on the `AVPlayer` instance directly by accessing
 *      the `player` property. You should use the player creation and destruction blocks to install and remove them reliably.
 *    - `AVPlayer` periodic time observers only trigger when the player actually plays. In some cases, you still want to
 *      perform periodic updates even when playback is paused (e.g. updating the user interface while a DVR stream is paused).
 *      For such use cases, `SRGMediaPlayerController` provides the `-addPeriodicTimeObserverForInterval:queue:usingBlock:`
 *      method, with which such observers can be defined. These observers being managed by the controller, you can set them
 *      up right after controller creation if you like.
 *
 *  For more information about `AVPlayer` observers, please refer to the official Apple documentation.
